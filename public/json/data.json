Due to Covid-19 it's hard to arrange skating tours as we usually do. Our normal tours are canceled right now.  But we can offer guided skating tours in a different way from what we usually do.",
      "text2": "You have to arrange the transports yourself. We find out where we are going to skate and meet you on the ice. If you need equipment, we will of course arrange it. We can also arrange accomodation, but we will not spend time with you in the evenings.",
