                <p>We always travel in small groups and most of our guests are private groups. We are maximum eight persons and one guide and travel in a minibus. If you are more than eight we use a second bus.</p>
                <p>The guide picks you up at the airport or where you like to be picked up. If possible we go directly for skating on a good lake nearby. All skating equipment is provided.</p>Where we skate depends on the ice and weather situation, we always choose the area that provides the best skating conditions. The accommodations are located in the area but could change from day to day depending on where we choose to go skating.

              <v-card-text>We start with breakfast where we also prepare our lunch packages. As soon as everyone is ready we head off for skating. If we are lucky we can walk from our accommodation directly out on the ice. Otherwise we take the minibus to the lake. The guide is always first, checking the ice and looking out for weak spots. The speed and distance is adjusted to the group and the ice condition. Now and then we take short stops to admire the beautiful landscape, chat for a while or just rest. During the day we go ashore from time to time, for the first or second lunch break or for walking to another lake nearby. At the end of the day we return to the minibus and head back to the hotel/hostel. A nice sauna before the dinner is a pleasant experience. If the conditions are right we might go for another skating trip in moonlight late in the evening.</v-card-text>

                ></v-img>We use special skates well adopted for Nordic skating. They are longer than hockey or figure skates. The front has a long curve compared to speed skates with sharp front, which is necessary if the ice in not completely smooth. And most important, the skate and the boot are separate so you can take off the skate when walking to and from the ice. If you have suitable skates, for example the Salomon skates, you may use them if you like.

                <p>Safety is an important issue. We cover great distances on the ice during a day. The whole time we keep track of the quality of the ice and avoid all weak areas. If someone should break through the ice the safety equipment we have helps us to pick the person up in a minute. And soon all wet clothes are changed to dry and warm clothes. The skating trip can continue.</p>
                <p>PS: The only time we had a person falling into the water, they did not follow the given instructions.</p>
